Except for this as yet problematic danger, however, there is not the slightest scientific ground for setting any limit in advance to our technical productive and cultural possibilities.

Why do we speak of militarization? Of course, this is only an analogy &ndash; but an analogy very rich in content. No social organization except the army has ever considered itself justified in subordinating citizens to itself in such a measure, and to control them by its will on all sides to such a degree, as the State of the proletarian dictatorship considers itself justified in doing, and does. Only the army &ndash; just because in its way it used to decide questions of the life or death of nations, States, and ruling classes &ndash; was endowed with powers of demanding from each and all complete submission to its problems, aims, regulations, and orders.
