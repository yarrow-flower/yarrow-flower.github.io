    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c14 c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9 c11">by Yarrow </span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c7 c9">“The present Soviet Union does not stand
        above the world level of economy, but is only trying to catch up to the
        capitalist countries. If Marx called that society which was to be formed
        upon the basis of a socialization of the productive forces of the most
        advanced capitalism of its epoch, the lowest stage of communism, then
        this designation obviously does not apply to the Soviet Union, which is
        still today considerably poorer in technique, culture and the good
        things of life than the capitalist countries.”</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8">–Leon Trotsky, </span><span class="c7">The
        Revolution Betrayed</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1936)</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7 c9">“Marxism sets out from the development of
        technique as the fundamental spring of progress, and constructs the
        communist program upon the dynamic of the productive forces. If you
        conceive that some cosmic catastrophe is going to destroy our planet in
        the fairly near future, then you must, of course, reject the communist
        perspective along with much else. Except for this as yet problematic
        danger, however, there is not the slightest scientific ground for
        setting any limit in advance to our technical productive and cultural
        possibilities. Marxism is saturated with the optimism of progress, and
        that alone, by the way, makes it irreconcilably opposed to religion.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7 c9">The material premise of communism should
        be so high a development of the economic powers of man that productive
        labor, having ceased to be a burden, will not require any goad, and the
        distribution of life’s goods, existing in continual abundance, will not
        demand – as it does not now in any well-off family or “decent”
        boarding-house – any control except that of education, habit and social
        opinion.”</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8">–Leon Trotsky, </span><span class="c7">The
        Revolution Betrayed</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1936)</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I am looking into Leon Trotsky’s beliefs
        because I've heard some people (including my best friend) drop Trotsky's
        name as the cool, chill Soviet communist 😎 as opposed to the sinister
        Lenin (and the genocidal Stalin).</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I looked into what Trotsky actually believed
        because I didn't know anything about him beyond that he was assassinated
        with an ice pick.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">On one hand, what he wrote about the
        militarization of labour is blatantly totalitarian (or, as the kids like
        to say these days, "fascist") and pure evil:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7 c9">“The foundations of the militarization of
        labor are those forms of State compulsion without which the replacement
        of capitalist economy by the Socialist will for ever remain an empty
        sound. Why do we speak of militarization? Of course, this is only an
        analogy – but an analogy very rich in content. No social organization
        except the army has ever considered itself justified in subordinating
        citizens to itself in such a measure, and to control them by its will on
        all sides to such a degree, as the State of the proletarian dictatorship
        considers itself justified in doing, and does. Only the army – just
        because in its way it used to decide questions of the life or death of
        nations, States, and ruling classes – was endowed with powers of
        demanding from each and all complete submission to its problems, aims,
        regulations, and orders. And it achieved this to the greater degree, the
        more the problems of military organization coincided with the
        requirements of social development.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7 c9">The question of the life or death of
        Soviet Russia is at present being settled on the labor front; our
        economic, and together with them our professional and productive
        organizations, have the right to demand from their members all that
        devotion, discipline, and executive thoroughness, which hitherto only
        the army required.”</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8">–Leon Trotsky, </span><span class="c7">Terrorism
        and Communism</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1920)</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, I don't see him as the cool, chill
        communist 😎 at all. His views on the individual person's absolute
        subordination to the state were not so different from Hitler's. (That's
        not an exaggeration.)</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I also think "proletarian dictatorship" is an
        insidious oxymoron that tries to get people to swallow something
        unpalatable (dictatorship) by attaching a word to it that doesn't, in
        reality, apply. It makes as little sense as "populist hierarchy" or
        "democratic monarchy". </span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can't just put two words that mean the
        opposite together and pretend that makes sense.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(I know “democratic monarchy” is a term used
        as a synonym for “constitutional monarchies”, but so-called “democratic
        monarchies” like the UK are just parliamentary liberal democracies.
        Monarchs don’t play a meaningful role in setting policy or the executive
        administration of the government.)</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">But I was intrigued to see that Trotsky had a
        savvy and perspicacious take on "the society of abundance" or the
        post-scarcity society. This is something I find gets glossed over or
        brushed aside 95%+ of the time by people who advocate socialism or
        communism.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c10"><span class="c4">Why communism requires abundance</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8">In my undergrad studies, I took a full course
        on </span><span class="c7">Das Kapital</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and
        nothing else. So, I got a really good exposure to Marx's original
        writings, which were a lot different from what I had expected after 150
        years of playing telephone and getting an impression of what Marx said
        filtered through generations of other thinkers.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is a lot of weird stuff in that book
        that caught me off guard. </span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">One thing that's really important: unlike
        subsequent thinkers like Trotsky or Lenin, Marx said very, very, very
        little in the book about what, practically, a socialist or communist
        revolution or a transition to a socialist or communist mode of
        production would or should look like.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I recall, the instructor said there was
        basically one sentence in the book, which simply said that the workers
        should seize the means of production from the capitalists.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">There are also pages-long digressions into
        the price of corn in England in the mid-1800s. One big difference
        between Marx and the writers who call themselves Marxists today, who are
        like mostly trendy literary theorists and existentialist philosophers,
        is that Marx was completely devoted to the science of economics and
        pushing forward the cutting-edge of economic science such as it existed
        during his time.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">The point being:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I
        think whether you rely on Marx as a source or contemporary economics as
        a source, or both, either way you get to the same conclusion as Leon
        Trotsky as regards the necessity of material superabundance or a
        post-scarcity economy as the prelude to socialism or communism.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c10"><span class="c4">Accelerationism</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">This leads into an obscure and confusing term
        in far leftist economic theory: accelerationism. Annoyingly,
        accelerationism is used to mean two completely different and almost
        opposite things, and it's rarely defined anywhere in a clear and
        succinct way.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you Google "accelerationism", you're going
        to find a bunch of impenetrable, edgelord-y essays written by people
        doing their best impression of a Parisian existentialist philosopher in
        the 1950s.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I'm going to coin two new terms to make this
        more clear. (The philosopher’s motto: when in doubt, make a
        distinction!)</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6 c17">Destructive economic accelerationism,
        or just destructive accelerationism:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c7 c9">The economy is like a car speeding
        towards a concrete wall. It's inevitably going to crash into the wall,
        and once it does, something good will ultimately come from the crash. </span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5 c3"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c7 c9">We should speed up the crash because
        the sooner we get it over with, the sooner we'll get to that "something
        good".</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6 c17">Creative economic accelerationism, or
        just creative accelerationism:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c7 c9">The economy is like a car speeding on
        an endless, straight road. The car is going faster and faster.
        Eventually, it will go so fast that the wheels break contact with the
        asphalt and the car begins to fly.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5 c3"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c7 c9">We should speed up the economy/the car
        to get to that point, since that will be a lot better than the status
        quo.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Destructive accelerationists think capitalism
        is inevitably headed for collapse, so we might as well give it that
        extra push and make it collapse sooner.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Creative accelerationists think, like Trotsky
        wrote, socialism/communism can only be achieved once capitalism reaches
        a certain point of development it hasn't reached yet. So, we should
        speed it up to get to socialism/communism sooner.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Creative accelerationists come from a very
        different intellectual background, but their views are more or less
        aligned with fairly mainstream economists like John Maynard Keynes, who
        wrote a famous essay called “Economic Possibilities for Our
        Grandchildren” in 1930, which imagined a time, roughly a century hence,
        when everyone in developed economies could enjoy a comfortable lifestyle
        with lots of leisure time and very little working hours.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c10"><span class="c4">Growth</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">In practical terms, gross world product per
        capita is about $11,000 U.S. (nominal) or $18,000 U.S. adjusted for
        purchasing power parity (PPP), i.e. the lower cost of goods in nations
        with lower incomes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8">From 1900 to 2000, gross world product
        increased </span><span class="c8 c13"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-gdp-over-the-last-two-millennia&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1634747527932000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0619sfpFqGX0V0DuE3pWT4">about
          15x</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8">That's total, not per capita. Couldn't
        immediately find per capita stats, although you could calculate them if
        you just divided gross world product (GWP) by population in 1900 and in
        2000. (The world population trebled during the 20th century. Today,
        birth rates and population growth in most developed countries has
        dramatically slowed to the point that population </span><span class="c7">decline</span><span
        class="c0">&nbsp;is a serious prospect in some nations.)</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">A creative accelerationist might say (just
        making this up hypothetically, to illustrate the idea) that once gross
        world product per capita increases 15x to $165,000 nominal or $270,000
        PPP, then the material conditions for socialism/communism will exist.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">And not only will the material conditions
        exist, but material superabundance will by itself exert a political
        pressure on societies to re-organize themselves along
        socialist/communist lines.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(Some people might even take a historical
        determinist perspective on this, i.e. they might think it's inevitable,
        but I always like to keep in mind there could always be another Hitler
        who wins the world war, or other world historical disruptions could
        happen that knock off the expected course of things.)</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8">Whether you're a creative accelerationist
        communist, an adherent of Keynesian economics, or an advocate of Thomas
        Piketty's participatory socialism for the 21st century (outlined in his
        book </span><span class="c7">Capital and Ideology)</span><span class="c0">,
        the question is the same:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7 c9">How to rapidly, sustainably, humanely,
        &nbsp;and equitably increase per capita GWP by something like 5x, 10x,
        or more?</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">A lot of contemporary radical leftists either
        completely overlook the topic of per capita GWP or they embrace
        anti-growth ideology, which is incompatible with both Marxism and global
        humanitarianism.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I find it so helpful to quote Trotsky, the
        not-actually-but-allegedly cool, chill communist 😎, pointedly asking
        the same question in the 1920s and 1930s and insisting radical GWP
        growth was a necessary material pre-requisite for socialism or
        communism.</span></p>

    <p class="c10"><span class="c4">Modern Marxism</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you take most mainstream leftist
        economists (which today is more or less mainstream academic economics in
        most of the developed world) believe and you take what many contemporary
        leftist activists who call themselves socialist, communist, or Marxist
        believe, there is a surface-level chasm in conceptual vocabulary and
